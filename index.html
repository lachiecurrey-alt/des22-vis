    <p><strong>Concept Statement:</strong> Purpose Driven Vision is an enhanced reality glasses system designed to enhance human perception on switching between adapted visual modes. Each mode highlights and features corresponding to daily tasks such as navigation, safety, social interactions, and work. In a futuristic world full of data and sensory overload, these glasses encourage individuals to focus on what really matters, ultimately changing how we interact with our environment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Overpopulated city">
    <p><strong>Context / Problem:</strong> As cities overpopulate and digital information floods our lives, humans face the challenge of processing all this information, making it overwhelming. Navigating busy streets, keeping themselves and others safe, staying creative, and connecting socially all become more difficult due to constant distractions. Traditional ways of seeing and interpreting the world no longer meet the demand of a complex, data-rich environment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Navigation overlay on street">
    <p><strong>Technology / Interaction:</strong> Purpose Driven Vision glasses use advanced sensors and algorithms to adapt visual information for real-time situations. Users of these glasses can switch between modes with simple voice commands or gestures. For example, a navigation mode would overlay clear arrows, distances, and live traffic data to guide users safely and quickly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Safety hazard symbols">
    <p>Safety mode would highlight potential hazards, such as moving vehicles. Creative mode would transform surroundings into an interactive canvas. Other modes, including work and social mode, would offer adapted information to boost productivity and strengthen human interactions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="image5.jpg" alt="Creative interaction concept">
    <p><strong>User Experience / Impact:</strong> By personalizing a userâ€™s perception, the glasses reduce sensory overload, increasing focus on everyday life and improving awareness of the surrounding environment. Everyday safety is enhanced as hazards become more visible, and social interactions become smoother with real-time contextual information. However, these benefits raise questions about how much humans should rely on technology to shape reality and daily life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="image6.jpg" alt="Reflection concept">
    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Purpose Driven Vision points towards a future where technology not only extends our senses but redefines how we perceive the world itself. As our reality enhances, we must consider how to balance enhancement and authenticity, and reflect on how this vision could shape the human experience. Integrating these ideas into interactive and immersive experiences highlights the evolving relationship between humans and technology.</p>
